What is Nooku Framework?
-------------------------

Nooku Framework is a open-source **extension framework** for **[Joomla](http://www.joomla.org)**. Developed and maintained by
[Timble](http://timble.net) with the help of passionate developers from all over the world.

Nooku Framework can be installed in Joomla as a plugin and lets you focus on the "business" logic of your extension. By
doing most of the repetitive work for you [boilerplate code][boilerplate] is eliminated which greatly reduces the time
to develop Joomla extensions.

The design pattern based architecture makes your extension more flexible: your extension becomes more **re-usable**,
**replaceable** and more easily **extensible**. Additionally Nooku Framework provides you with excellent **out-of-the-box
 security** features.

Nooku Framework uses a [component based architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering)
and includes everything needed to create Joomla extensions according to the [Hierarchical Model-View-Contoller][HMVC]
**(HMVC)** pattern.

Why Nooku Framework?
--------------------

Nooku Framework is built to help developers create **custom** Joomla extensions and tries to solve following problems:

* Abstract differences between Joomla versions 2.x and 3.x.
* Provide a solid modern and lean architecture for building extensions.
* Allow extensions to be more flexible and extended easily.

Who is Nooku Framework for ?
----------------------------

Nooku Framework is for developers creating custom Joomla extensions. The framework can only be installed using Composer
and cannot be installed using the Joomla installer. If you are a developer who wishes to distribute the framework as part
of an installable package please [contact us](http://www.timble.net/contact/) first.

Production Ready
----------------

The framework uses a conservative development approach focused on the lowest common denominator, at time of writing this
is Joomla 2.5 and PHP 5.2. The framework is fully forwards compatible with Joomla 3.x and PHP 5.x.

The framework follows the [semantic versioning standard](http://semver.org/). Rest assured : it's designed for stability
and compatibility. We promise that all minor versions will be 100% backwards compatible. Only in major versions backwards
compatibility is not guaranteed.

*Note* : If you are looking for the the greatest and latest stuff we are working on check out [Nooku Platform][nooku-platform],
a fork from Joomla that is being completely rebuild using Nooku Framework.

Requirements
------------

* Joomla 2.5 and 3.x
* PHP 5.2 or newer
* MySQL 5.x

Installation
------------

Go to the root directory of your Joomla installation in command line and execute this command:

```
composer require nooku/nooku-framework:2.*
```

Contributing
------------

We appreciate any contribution to Nooku Framework, whether it is related to bugs, grammar, or simply a suggestion or
improvement. We ask that any contribution follows a few simple guidelines in order to be properly received.

We follow the [GitFlow][gitflow-model] branching model, from development to release. If you are not familiar with it,
there are several guides and tutorials to make you understand what it is about. If you haven't, you will probably want
to get started by installing this very good collection of [git extensions][gitflow-extensions].

What you should know before submitting a pull request :

- If you are submitting a bug-fix, or an enhancement that is not a breaking change, submit your pull request to the
branch corresponding to the latest stable release of the framework, such as the 2.0 `release` branch
-  If you are submitting a breaking change or an entirely new feature, submit your pull request against the `develop`
branch.
- It's very well appreciated, and highly suggested, to start a new feature branch whenever you want to make changes or
add functionalities. It will make it much easier for us to just checkout your feature branch and test it, before merging
it into `develop`
- We will not consider pull requests made to the `master`.
